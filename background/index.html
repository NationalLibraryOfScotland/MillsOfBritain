			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			
			<p>Mills have been iconic features on our rivers and landscapes for nearly two millennia.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> Widely considered to be some of the most powerful, elaborate and costly machines constructed outside of wartime by early modern and premodern societies<sup><a href="#note1">2</a></sup>, <a href="projects/mills/about.html">water- and windmills</a> provided the mechanical power used for a wide range of processing and industrial activities necessary for everyday life. </p>
				
			<p> This <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/#zoom=6.0&lat=54.80000&lon=-4.00000.html"> viewer</a> allows you to explore the mills that were mapped in 18-19th century British maps. Mills were <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/project/mills.html"> identified </a> from <a href="/counties/info.html">county maps</a> (1729-1836) and <a href="/roy/">Roy Military Survey of Scotland maps</a> (1747-1755) as part of a <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/project.html"> Leverhulme Trust project</a> based at the University of Glasgow. </p>

			<h2>Early County Maps: A Technical Revolution </h2>
			
			<p>We use <a href="/counties/info.html">county maps</a> as one line of evidence to trace industrialisation processes transforming landscapes and society before publication of more systematic maps by the Ordnance Survey (OS), Britain’s national mapping agency, in the early- to middle 19th century. Large-scale county maps, surveyed at the one-inch-to-the-mile scale (1:63,360), marked the beginning of a technical revolution in British cartography. Before ~1750, county maps were usually copied from earlier maps, poorly revised—if at all—and published at a far lower resolution than their later counterparts. Yet in the half-century preceding the first government-sponsored mapping efforts (the OS Old Series), new county maps became increasingly accurate and based on original field surveys.<sup><a href="#note1">3</a></sup> </p>

				<div class="imgcap"><strong>Figure 1. Example 18th century county map with watermills</strong>. We noted mills on over 140 early county maps made by an array of map-makers. Watermills were often indicated on early county maps with waterwheel symbols (small circles with radiating spokes or vanes). Source: Yates' 1786 county map of Lancaster (<a href="/joins/10434.html">View map</a>).</div>
				
			
			</div>
			
			<p>Funded by a variety of private enterprise and encouraged by awards set by the Society for Arts after 1759<sup><a href="#note1">4</a></sup>, more than 100 new county map surveys were conducted from one- to four-inches-to-the-mile scales in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A diverse array of amateur and professional mapmakers used some of the most advanced techniques of the time to conduct new surveys for their subscribing sponsors.<sup><a href="#note1">5</a></sup></p> 
				
			<p> Before financial support by the central government began in the middle 19th century for national-scale OS mapping, carrying out accurate <i>and</i> timely surveys was exceedingly expensive and logistically very difficult. This often led to considerable debt and bankruptcy (or worse) for individuals involved in the map-making trade, including many notable makers such as Thomas Jefferys, Charles Price, John Senex, Emanuel Bowen, Andrew Dury, Peter Burdett, Andrew Bryant, John Thompson, and the Greenwood brothers.<sup><a href="#note1">6</a></sup></p>
			
			
			<p>By ~1800, however, mapmakers’ efforts produced not only beautiful but increasingly accurate engraved maps for nearly all of England, lowland Scotland and much of Wales. Many of the individuals involved with county surveys helped give rise to the incipient Ordnance Survey (then, the Trigonometric Survey of the Board of Ordnance)<sup><a href="#note1">7</a></sup>  and established the modern one-inch map as a cartographic standard.<sup><a href="#note1">8</a></sup>  By the 1820s, nearly every county was mapped at one-inch-to-the-mile scale, with detailed maps widely available for purchase by people of all classes and professions alike.</p>

				<div class="imgcap"><strong>Figure 2. Dates of survey for county maps consulted in this project</strong>. Dates refer to the last year of survey or revision when indicated, else the year of publication is used. For maps in county atlases (i.e., <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/atlas/thomson/"> John Thomson's 1832 Atlas of Scotland</a>), the late date of original survey used unless new survey and/or considerable revison noted by Thomson. Not all county maps that were published are included; many do not clearly indicate mills and/or were unavailable for consultation. County boundary areas often have more survey periods than indicated here due to overlap between neighbouring surveys. Darker gray = more surveys per county. </div>

				<h2>The Value of Early County Maps </h2>		
				
			<p>The new surveyance, spatial coverage and scale of county maps alone make them a valuable collection of historic information. They exist for almost every British county and often at multiple survey periods. Despite some known issues regarding their accuracy, standardisation, and comprehensiveness when compared to subsequent OS maps, county maps were importantly both publically available and had coverage for almost all of Britain. The one-inch Old Series, the earliest maps produced by the OS, covered only part of England and Wales, with no coverage of Scotland.<sup><a href="#note1">9</a></sup> It was not until the middle of the 19th century that the popular first edition OS&nbsp; <a href="/os/6inch-england-and-wales/">six-inch</a> and <a href="/os/25inch-england-and-wales/">25-inch</a> maps and town plans were available for&nbsp; <a href="/os/#scotland">Scotland,</a> <a href="/os/#england">England, and Wales</a>.</p>

			  <div class="imgcap"><strong>Figure 3.  Dates of survey for one-inch Old Series</strong>. Early map data are cumulative by nature. Although it could be assumed that map sheets were surveyed and published synchronously, in truth these processes took place over long intervals of time. The first surveys  for the Old Series conducted by the Trigonometric Board of Ordnance could span a decade or more, much like the&nbsp; county map surveys.

			</div>


			<p> Large-scale county maps importantly document early industrial development at the regional to national level during a period of history often referred to as the ‘Industrial Revolution’. During this period, advances in technology, changes in social structure, and shifting agricultural practices transformed the social, economic, physical landscape. In this way, early county maps produced after 1700 and before ca. 1840 stand as one of richest and arguably most comprehensive cartographic sources of industrial location information for Britain.<sup><a href="#note1">10</a></sup></p>
			
				<h2>The Roy Military Survey of Scotland </h2>		

			<p>Following the Jacobite Rebellion in 1745-1746, the Board of Ordnance instigated the first detailed (one inch to 1000 yards) military reconnaissance of the Scottish Highlands (1748-1752) and the Lowlands (1752-1755). The <a href="/roy/">Roy Military Survey of Scotland</a>, under the superintendence of William Roy, set important precedents not only for 18th century British standards for <a href="/roy/scope.html">mapping</a> and <a href="/roy/style.html">cartography</a>, but critically influenced the practices of the emerging body of the  Board of Ordnance.<sup><a href="#note1">11</a></sup>  Copies, notes and sketches from the military survey were typically unavailable to private cartographers of the time; although cartographer <a href="/geo/explore/#zoom=7.0&lat=56.81260&lon=-4.91600&layers=123969245&b=ESRIWorld&o=100">Aaron Arrowsmith</a> was later able to access materials archived in the Royal Library when drawing up his popular map of Scotland published in 1807.<sup><a href="#note1">12</a></sup></p>

			</div>			
			
			<p>For many regions of Scotland, the Roy Map is the most detailed—and often <i>only</i>—map available for the entire 18th century until renewed OS mapping (or privately-funded mapping) was conducted more than half a century later. Therefore the Roy Map remains a valuable cartographic resource for the early industrial period in Scotland. Yet even the Roy Map is not without its critics regarding its accuracy, including Roy himself.<sup><a href="#note1">13</a></sup>   It has limitations and deficiencies in terms of its triangulation and representation of topography, like many early county maps and even early sheets of the Old Series, with some noted differences existing between the protracted and fair copies.<sup><a href="#note1">14</a></sup></p>

			<li>Jefferys was especially committed to the production of high-quality surveys over multiple counties and went bankrupt in 1766 after a series of unfortunate events. Senex likewise was financially stretched after his only survey of Surrey; Bowen died in poverty and Price’s debt led him to Fleet Prison. Burdett, heavy with debt, abandoned his family and left England for Saxony permanently in 1774. Bryant frequently had problems paying staff wages and was brought to court by his engraver in 1826. Prolific publication of the first one-inch maps further curtailed private enterprise into the 1830s; several private county surveyors went out of business like the Greenwood and Thompson firms in 1828 and 1830, respectively.
