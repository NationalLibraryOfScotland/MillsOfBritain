			<h1>Background</h1>
			
			<p>Mills have been iconic features on our rivers and landscapes for nearly two millennia.<sup>1</sup> Widely considered to be some of the most powerful, elaborate and costly machines constructed outside of wartime by early modern and premodern societies<sup>2</sup> , <a href="projects/mills/about.html">water- and windmills</a> provided the mechanical power used for a wide range of processing and industrial activities necessary for everyday life. Our database compiles evidence about mills and their locations using the graphical, textual and positional information of these features as preserved in early British maps. </p>

			<p>For more information about the history of mills and different kinds of mills, please visit the <a href="/projects/mills/about.html">About section</a> of the <a href="/projects/mills/">Scottish water mills website</a> for a brief overview.</p> 

			<h2>County Maps: A Technical Revolution </h2>
			
			<p>We use <a href="/counties/info.html">early county maps</a> as one line of evidence to trace industrialisation processes transforming landscapes and society before publication of more systematic maps in the nineteenth century by Britain’s national mapping agency, the Ordnance Survey. County maps surveyed at the one inch to the mile scale (1:63,360) marked the beginning of a technical revolution in the history of British cartography. Before ~1750 CE, county maps were copied from earlier maps, poorly revised—if at all—and published at a far lower resolution than their later counterparts. Yet in the half-century preceding the first government-sponsored mapping efforts (the Old Series), new county maps became increasingly accurate and based on original field surveys.<sup>3</sup> </p>

			</div>
			
			<p>Funded by a variety of private enterprise and encouraged by awards set by the Society for Arts after 1759 CE,<sup>4</sup>  well over one hundred new county map surveys were conducted at the one- to four-inches to the mile scales into the early nineteenth century. A diverse array of amateur and professional mapmakers used some of the most advanced techniques of the time in the field to produce county maps for their subscribing sponsors.<sup>5</sup>  Before financial support by the central government in the mid-eighteenth century, carrying out accurate and timely surveys was exceedingly expensive and logistically difficult. This often led to considerable debt and bankruptcy (or worse) for numerous individuals involved in the map-making trade, including Thomas Jefferys, Charles Price, John Senex, Emanuel Bowen, Andrew Dury, Peter Burdett, Andrew Bryant, John Thompson, and the Greenwood brothers.<sup>6</sup> </p>
			
			
			<p>By ca.1800 CE, however, mapmakers’ efforts produced not only beautiful but increasingly accurate engraved maps for nearly all of England, lowland Scotland and much of Wales. Many of the individuals involved with county surveys helped give rise to the incipient Ordnance Survey (then, the Trigonometric Survey of the Board of Ordnance; see Seymour)<sup>7</sup>  and established the modern one-inch map as a cartographic standard.<sup>8</sup>  By the 1820s, nearly every county was mapped at one inch to the mile resolution, with detailed maps from these surveys widely available to people of all classes and professions alike.</p>

Dates refer to the last year of survey when indicated or otherwise known from each entire published county map, else the year of publication is used. Not all county maps published are included; many do not clearly indicate mills and/or were unavailable for consultation. County boundary areas often have more survey periods than indicated here due to overlap between neighbouring surveys.</div>

				<h2>The Value of Early County Maps </h2>		
				
			<p>Large-scale county map coverage exists for almost every British county and often at multiple survey periods. Despite some known issues regarding early county map accuracy, standardisation, comprehensiveness when compared to subsequent Ordnance Survey mapping, the popular <a href="/os/6inch-england-and-wales/">six-inch</a> and <a href="/os/25inch-england-and-wales/">25-inch</a> edition Ordnance Survey maps and plans were published only after the middle of the nineteenth century for much of <a href="/os/#scotland">Scotland</a> <a href="/os/#england">England and Wales</a>. Even the Ordnance Survey’s earliest maps, the one-inch Old Series, covered only part of England and Wales, with no coverage of Scotland.<sup>9</sup> </p>

				<div class="imgcap"><strong>Figure 3</strong>. Early map data are cumulative by nature. Although it could be assumed that map sheets were surveyed and published synchronously, in truth these processes took place over long intervals of time. The first surveys conducted by the Trigonometric Board of Ordnance for the Old Series could span a decade or more, much like the earlier and contemporary county map surveys.

			<p>The new surveyance, spatial coverage and resolution of county maps alone make them a valuable collection of historic information. Large-scale county maps importantly document early industrial development at the regional to national level during a period of history often referred to as the ‘Industrial Revolution’. During this period, advances in technology, changes in social structure, and shifting agricultural practices transformed the social, economic, physical landscape. In this way, early county maps produced after 1700 and before ca. 1840 stand as one of richest and arguably most comprehensive cartographic source of industrial location information for Britain.<sup>10</sup> </p>
			
				<h2>The Roy Military Survey of Scotland </h2>		

			<p>Following the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745-1746 CE, the Board of Ordnance instigated the first detailed (one inch to 1000 yards) military reconnaissance of the Scottish Highlands (1748-1752 CE) and the Lowlands (1752-1755 CE). The <a href="/roy/">Roy Military Survey of Scotland</a>, under the superintendence of William Roy, set important precedents not only for eighteenth century British standards for <a href="/roy/scope.html">mapping</a> and <a href="/roy/style.html">cartography</a> but critically influenced the practices of the emerging body of the Trigonometric Survey of the Board of Ordnance.<sup>11</sup>  Copies, notes and sketches from the military survey were typically unavailable to private cartographers of the time, although cartographer Aaron Arrowsmith was later able to access materials archived in the Royal Library when drawing up his map of Scotland published in 1807 CE.<sup>12</sup>   </p>

			</div>			
			
			<p>For many regions of Scotland, especially so for the Highlands, the Roy Map is the most detailed—and often only—map available for the entire eighteenth-century until private and/or Ordnance Survey mapping was conducted more than half a century later. Therefore the Roy Map remains a valuable cartographic resource for the early industrial period in Scotland. Yet even the Roy Map is not without its critics regarding its accuracy, including Roy himself.<sup>13</sup>   It has limitations and deficiencies in terms of triangulation and representation of topography, like many early county maps and even some of the first maps appearing in the Old Series.<sup>14</sup>    </p>

			<li>Jefferys was especially committed to the production of high-quality surveys over multiple counties and went bankrupt in 1766 after a series of unfortunate events. Senex likewise was financially stretched after his only survey of Surrey; Bowen died in poverty and Price’s debt led him to Fleet Prison. Burdett, heavy with debt, abandoned his family and left England for Saxony permanently in 1774. Bryant frequently had problems paying staff wages and was brought to court by his engraver in 1826. Prolific publication of the first one-inch maps further curtailed private enterprise into the 1830s; several private county surveyors went out of business like the Greenwood and Thompson firms in 1828 and 1830, respectively.
