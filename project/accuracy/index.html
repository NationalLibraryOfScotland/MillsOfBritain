				<h1>Accuracy and Georeferencing</h1>		
				
				<p>Large-scale county maps are incredible historical resources and arguably offer the most comprehensive source of spatial information on milling at the regional to national-level in Britain outside of documents produced for insurance companies and Parliamentary inquiries. Yet, like most historical resources, early maps are the cumulative product of their age and medium: with issues arising from their time and duration of survey, the scale, style and quality of their engraving, the quality of their preservation and curation, and certainly through their later scrutiny by researchers.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> </p>
				
				<hr></hr>
				
				<h2>Gaps and Bias: the Unseen Human Element&nbsp;</h2>
				
				<p>While maps certainly offer clues concerning the distribution and type of mills existing across the union at various times, we recognise that notable gaps and biases in the private county map surveys certainly exist. The impetus, aims, and products driving new surveys and production of county maps were wholly different than those of the Ordnance Survey. In any county map, it is important to remember that critical choices had to be made to simplify real, complex landscapes into legible commerical maps capable of generating profit. Such choices can quietly speak volumes about those involved. Intriguing lines of inquiry are documented by the inclusion, exclusion, and appending of particular features; all of which help us better understand the lives and <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/os/6inch/os_info5.html">choices</a> of people in the past tied to these collections. </p>
				
				<div align="center"><img src="../../img/fig7.jpg" width="318" alt="Different depictions of mills from different copies of Armstrong's map of Berwickshire" title="Missing mills (?) in Berwickshire" />
			
				<div class="imgcap"><strong>Figure 7. Variation in maps of the same year and edition</strong>.  Two copies, (a) <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/view/216442596">top</a> and (b) <a href="/view/74400212">middle</a>, of the Armstrong's 1771 map of Berwickshire</a>. Can you, eagle-eyed reader, spot some differences between these engraved maps? There are missing hills and a missing windmill (which did exist)! Was the middle copy appended by the engraver? The late 18-19th century was also rife with copy-cat printers, borrowing (pirating) others' materials. Are both legitimate (non-pirated) copies? Compare this with (c) <a href="/view/216442632">Blackadder’s 1797 map of Berwickshire</a> that did include a windmill between Gunsgreen and Netherbyres, but not the windmill on the hill south of Netherbyres. Is this the same mill or a different mill? Also note the change in function of the mill south of Linthill from a sawmill to a paper mill between 1771 and 1797.  </div>

				<h2>Number and Distribution of Historic Mills</h2>		

				<p>This resource should be used as a foundation for further work. Early county maps are only one type of resource to study mill numbers and distributions. We recommend that mill numbers from early maps offer robust but reliable minima, at the same order of magnitude of other estimates captured through other documentary and field evidence. Very few mills are listed as derelict, ‘ruined’, ‘burnt’ and ‘disused’ in our database, such that it is likely that surveyors made little distinction between active or abandoned mills at the times of survey. In a forthcoming article, we dive deep into what is shown, what is missing, and how truthfully the tens of thousands of mill records may (or may not) trace historic milling processes across regions of Britain. </p>
				
				<h2>Georeferencing and Spatial Accuracy</h2>

				<p><b>Note:</b> You may find that the locations of many mills may not coincide exactly with mill locations shown on later Ordnance Survey (OS) maps in the viewer. This could be due to several reasons we suggest below.</p>
				
	<h3>Distortion:</h3>
				
				<p>Sometimes the information held within early maps sheets is distorted to reality. This can be attributed to the relative accuracy of the instrumentation that informed early surveys<sup><a href="#note1">2</a></sup>,  to the differential shrinkage of the physical maps over time, and even to the scanning and digitisation of the maps themselves. These are the factors that make georeferencing archival map materials difficult and laborious. This is furthermore why we have chosen <em>not</em> to include the Roy Highland and Lowlands map sheets (<a href="/geo/roy/">Roy Viewer</a>) and county map sheets held by the NLS as background options in the <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/#zoom=6.0&lat=54.80000&lon=-4.00000.html"> Mills of Britain viewer</a>. However, due to the spatial relationship between many mills and long-lived features, such as the bends of rivers, crests of hills, or intersections of toll roads, the relative positions of many mills can be ascertained even from map sheets that do not necessarily accord with reality.</p>
		
				To <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/projects/mills-of-britain/#zoom=6.0&lat=54.80000&lon=-4.00000">view each scanned map associated with a mill record</a>, please click on a mill record to bring up the record information and click on <em>'Map Hyperlink'</em> to open a separate webpage where the map can be viewed. In some cases, data were extracted from paper map sheets that can be only viewed in the British Library.
		
	<h3>Moving the Mill:</h3> 
	<p>Occasionally, windmills were moved to a different location that was more favourable for a variety of reasons. This could be done more easily with timber-based post-mills rather than sunken post-mills or stone-armored tower mills. While the original materials (i.e., post, sails, cladding, interal gearing and stones) were inherited, the 'new' windmill was set up elsewhere. In <a href="https://rutlandcountymuseum.org.uk/windmills-of-my-mind/">some documented cases</a>, post-mills were moved from their original site (i.e., hill) and sited alongside a watermill. This may have allowed one miller to look after both and allow work to be conducted when water-powered milling was halted. In many cases, we find evidence of windmills alongside watermills in our database. 
		
		
				<h3>Destruction and Rebuilding:</h3>

				<p>Mill buildings lived a hazardous existence and were prone to damage by fire and flood. While any one mill site could be occupied for decades to centuries, the lifespan of a mill building was typically much shorter. Rebuilding and even expansion of mills could also be expected to shift the location, if only slightly.</p>
				
				<h3>River avulsion, canalisation and channelisation:</h3> 
				
				<p>The river channel upon which watermills were sited could have naturally migrated or moved through time. While river channel migration can be a very slow process, some rivers may have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_(river)">avulsed</a>, or changed channel more rapidly, during a watermill’s lifespan. This is far less likely to affect the position of watermills compared to the artificial canalisation and river channelisation by people.<sup><a href="#note1">3</a></sup>  Straightening or rerouting of rivers to improve navigation was a common practice across Britain, especially over the last 300 years before <a href="https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/occupations/onlineatlas/railways.html">major roads and rail</a> were constructed and improved.<sup><a href="#note1">4</a></sup>  If watermills were rebuilt following changes in river channels, some mill records may document this. </p>
				
				<h3>Human Error: </h3>

				<p>Besides distortion, much of the location error is likely due to human error. We suggest that mill locations are generally within about 500 metres of their noted location <em>on maps</em>. This primarily accounts for the distortion of early maps and our own manual geolocation at a regional- to national level. Importantly, however, this assumes that the original surveyors and engravers recorded the mill location accurately—which was not always the case! To make a map more legible and pleasing to the eye, a cartographer had to portray features that did not necessarily accord with real-world proportions or location.</p>
					
				<p><p style="margin-left: 35px; margin-right: 35px; color:rgba(138,127,125,1.00)"> <i>"The prime role of any map is to convert the messiness and infinite variety of an actual landscape into an artificially simplified model".<sup><a href="#note1">5</a></sup> </i> </p>
		
				<p>It is possible that we may need help ‘nudging’ some mill locations in the future—so please stay tuned! </p>
