			<p>The Mills of Britain database provides an interactive resource displaying mill locations compiled from select digitised eighteenth and nineteenth century maps. These detailed maps act as snapshots through time that allow us to reconstruct the distribution of mills across mainland Britain to shed light on the evolution of industry into the early nineteenth century.</p>
			
			<p>This resource was created by Dr Tara Jonell as part of the Leverhulme Trust-funded <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/awayfromthewater/">'Away from Water': The First Energy Transition, British Textiles 1770-1890 project</a>. This grant was awarded to Prof Emer Paul Bishop at the University of Glasgow and Dr Adam Lucas at the University of Wollongong from 2021âˆ’2024, and involved collaboration with Dr Peter Jones (now, Nottingham Trent University) and Prof Simon Naylor (University of Glasgow). Mill data in the viewer are primarily from <a href="/counties/info.html">early county maps</a>, select <a href=~"/estates/">estate maps</a>, and the <a href="/roy/gazetteer/">Roy Gazetteer</a> of the <a href="/roy/">Roy Military Survey of Scotland</a> that were compiled from several library collections. 			

			<p>You may notice that the early maps from which the data were derived are not shown in this viewer. This is mostly due to the distortion that is created when early maps are georeferenced that reduces their legibility (see <a href="accuracy/">Accuracy and Georeferencing</a>). For similar reasons, this is why the locations of many mills may not coincide exactly with locations of mills shown on later Ordnance Survey maps in the viewer.</p>
			
			<p>To view the scanned maps, please click on a mill record to bring up the record information and click on the 'Map Hyperlink' to open a separate webpage where the map can be viewed. In some cases, data were extracted from paper map sheets that can be only viewed in the British Library.</p>
			
			<p>Please check back in the future as we finalise other cartographic data for visualisation, including Ordnance Survey data from the <a href="/projects/mills/">Scottish water mills website</a> and the Ordnance Survey 2nd edition six-inch to the mile map series for England and Wales. </p>
