				<h2>Project Aims</h2>		
				
			<p>One of the larger aims of the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/awayfromthewater/">Leverhulme Trust project</a> was to develop an early industrial cartographic 'census' of watermill and windmill sites for Great Britain. The potential power of creating such a database was noted as early as 1962 CE by map historian J.B. Harley: "...By using [a] cartographic framework as a basis for field and documentary inquiry…the distribution of watermills of such surveys could more fully appraise the role of water power in the eighteenth century industrial revolution" and "...throw further light on the industrial geography of [that] period".  While we are not the first to compile a database of British mills,  we hope to provide one of the largest open digital collections of geolocated mill records acquired from cartographic resources for the entirety of mainland Britain. Our hope is that this dataset, which can be fully integrated into standard geographic information systems, will be of use to historians, archaeologists, geomorphologists, and green engineers.  </p>
			
			<p>Our primary objective in compiling this database is to determine the spatial distribution of watermills at a national level, not necessarily to document all <em>active</em> mill sites at any one time. To-date, we have located mills on over 140 large-scale county maps published before 1836 CE and from all map sheets of the William Roy Military Survey of Scotland conducted from 1747‒1755 CE. </p>

			<p>Our practice placed particular emphasis on acquiring two ‘snapshots’ of mill site distributions in time for each county; ideally a mid- to late eighteenth-century survey and an early to mid-nineteenth-century survey before more systematic Ordnance Surveys were conducted, widely published and available for consultation.  This broadly equates, at the national scale, to a pre-1800 CE snapshot and a post-1800 CE snapshot of mill site distributions in our database. For some counties, surveys conducted around the one inch to the mile or higher scale occurred only very early or late relative to others, if at all. We thus selected what large-scale county maps that were available through several open-access digital collections (see <a href="../mills/#sources">Cartographic Sources</a>), when possible. Many more county maps exist but not all carried details about mills.    </p>
