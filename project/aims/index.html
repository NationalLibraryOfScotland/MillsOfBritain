			<h1>Aims</h1>
				
			<p>One of the larger aims of the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/awayfromthewater/">Leverhulme Trust project</a> was to develop an early industrial cartographic 'census' of watermill and windmill sites for Great Britain. The potential power of creating such a database was noted by map historian J.B. Harley<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> in 1962:</p>
				
			<p><p style="margin-left: 35px; margin-right: 35px; color:rgba(138,127,125,1.00)"> <i> "...By using [a] cartographic framework as a basis for field and documentary inquiry…the distribution of watermills of such surveys could more fully appraise the role of water power in the eighteenth century industrial revolution" </i> and <i> "...throw further light on the industrial geography of [that] period".</i></p>
				
			<p>The boom in digital technologies and standard geographic information systems (GIS) in the 21st century make the creation of such a database from archival cartographic resources today much more feasible and manageable. While we recognise that we not the first to compile a database of British mills, we hoped to create one of the largest collections of georeferenced historic mill locations from maps for the entirety of mainland Britain. Our hope is that this dataset, which can be fully integrated into a GIS framework, will be of use to historians, archaeologists, geomorphologists, and green engineers.</p>

			<div class="imgcap"><strong>Animation 1. British watermills and windmills through time</strong>. Using 18-19th century <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/counties/">county maps</a> and the Roy Military Survey of Scotland <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/geo/roy/#zoom=7.5&lat=56.76368&lon=-3.33424&layers=0&search=windmill">Roy Gazetteer</a>, we mapped over 20,000 mills observed by surveyors from 1729-1836. Here, we show the number and distribution of watermills (left) and windmills (right) as new surveys were conducted across Scotland, England and Wales. Based on the average longevity of mill sites (as deduced from our database records), mill sites slowly 'vanish' over time until a new survey was conducted. This is done to reflect the overall uncertainty in their location/number from cartographic evidence until repeat observation by surveyors occurred. Notice that certain counties were only surveyed very early or very late compared to others, and not all county maps contained information about milling. For a static version of this figure, see <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/projects/mills-of-britain/background/">Background</a>. </div>

			<h2> Snapshots of History? </h2>
			<p>Our primary objective in compiling this <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/#zoom=6.0&lat=54.80000&lon=-4.00000.html"> viewer</a> and <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/explore/database.html"> database</a> was to determine the spatial distribution of mills at a national level, not necessarily to document all <em>active</em> mill sites at any one time. To-date, we have located mills on over 140 <a href="/counties/info.html">large-scale county maps (1729‒1836)</a> and from all map sheets of the <a href="/roy/">Roy Military Survey of Scotland (1747‒1755)</a>. </p>

			<p>Our practice placed particular emphasis on acquiring two ‘snapshots’ of mill site distributions in time for each county; ideally a mid- to late 18th century survey and an early to mid-19th century survey before more systematic OS map surveys were conducted, widely published and available for consultation by the public. This broadly equates, at the national scale, to a "pre-1800" snapshot and a "post-1800" snapshot of mill site distributions in our database. </p>
				
			<p>For some counties, detailed surveys conducted at the one-inch-to-the-mile or greater scale occurred only very early or late relative to others, if at all. We also selected large-scale county maps that were available through several digital collections (see <a href="../mills/#sources">Cartographic Sources</a>) that are openly accessible, whenever possible. We recognize that while many more county maps do exist, not all county maps contain detailed information about mills.    </p>
