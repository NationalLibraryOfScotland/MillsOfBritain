			<p>One of the larger aims of the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/awayfromthewater/">Leverhulme Trust project</a> was to develop an early industrial cartographic 'census' of watermill and windmill sites for Great Britain. The potential power of creating such a database was noted by map historian J.B. Harley<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> in 1962:</p>
				
			<p><p style="margin-left: 35px; margin-right: 35px; color:rgba(138,127,125,1.00)"> <i> "...By using [a] cartographic framework as a basis for field and documentary inquiry…the distribution of watermills of such surveys could more fully appraise the role of water power in the eighteenth century industrial revolution" </i> and <i> "...throw further light on the industrial geography of [that] period".</i></p>
				
			<p>The boom in digital technologies and standard geographic information systems (GIS) in the 21st century make the creation of such a database from archival cartographic resources today much more feasible and manageable. While we recognise that we not the first to compile a database of British mills, we hoped to create one of the largest collections of georeferenced historic mill locations from maps for the entirety of mainland Britain. Our hope is that this dataset, which can be fully integrated into a GIS framework, will be of use to historians, archaeologists, geomorphologists, and green engineers.</p>
			
			<h2> Snapshots of History? </h2>
			<p>Our primary objective in compiling this <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/#zoom=6.0&lat=54.80000&lon=-4.00000.html"> viewer </a> and <a href="/projects/mills-of-britain/explore/database.html"> database</a> was to determine the spatial distribution of watermills at a national level, not necessarily to document all <em>active</em> mill sites at any one time. To-date, we have located mills on over 140 <a href="/counties/info.html">large-scale county maps (1729‒1836)</a> and from all map sheets of the <a href="/roy/">Roy Military Survey of Scotland (1747‒1755)</a>. </p>

			<p>Our practice placed particular emphasis on acquiring two ‘snapshots’ of mill site distributions in time for each county; ideally a mid- to late 18th century survey and an early to mid-19th survey before more systematic OS surveys were conducted, widely published and available for consultation by the public. This broadly equates, at the national scale, to a "pre-1800" snapshot and a "post-1800" snapshot of mill site distributions in our database. </p>
				
			<p>For some counties, detailed surveys conducted at the one-inch-to-the-mile or greater scale occurred only very early or late relative to others, if at all. We thus selected what large-scale county maps that were available through several open-access digital collections (see <a href="../mills/#sources">Cartographic Sources</a>), when possible. We recognize that many more county maps exist, however not all county maps contained detailed information about mills.    </p>
