				<h2>Mills from Maps</h2>		
				
				<p>No central register of early or post-industrial mills exists in Great Britain. Although it has been claimed that 20,000 watermills existed throughout Britain by ~1800 CE,  this estimate was recently examined by our team.  This present work is partly informed by the work of earlier mill censuses  and built from several open-access databases to construct a georeferenced early industrial-era mill database for Britain. Almost all mill locations were found by examining high-resolution digitized copies of maps, with select mills recorded from the original county maps held at the British Library. </p>
				
				<h3><a name="a" id="sources"></a>Cartographic Sources</h3>
				
				<h4>County Maps</h4>
				
				<p>Data from large-scale county maps were manually collected from maps surveyed and published between 1729‒1836 CE in Scotland, England and Wales and held in collections of the National Library of Scotland, the British Library, the National Library of Wales, the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) Wiley Digital Archive, the National Library of France, the Digital Archive at McMaster University Library, the Yale University Library, the David Rumsey Map Collection at the University of Stanford Library. </p>
				
				<p>You may notice that the early maps from which the data were derived are not shown in this viewer. This is mostly due to the distortion that is created when early maps are georeferenced that reduces their legibility (see <a href="../accuracy/">Accuracy and Georeferencing</a>). For similar reasons, this is why the locations of many mills may not coincide exactly with locations of mills shown on later Ordnance Survey maps in the viewer.</p>
				
				<p>To view the scanned maps, please click on a mill record to bring up the record information and click on the ‘Map Hyperlink’ to open a separate webpage where the map can be viewed. In some cases, data were extracted from paper map sheets that can be only viewed in the British Library.</p>

				<h4>The Roy Gazetteer</h4>				
				
				<p>Data from 1747‒1755 CE were derived from the collaborative National Library of Scotland and British Library <a href="/roy/gazetteer/">Roy Gazetteer project</a>. It involved transcribing placenames from Roy Military Survey of Scotland map sheets. Raw locations and mill types were derived by either mill symbol or text via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponymy">toponymy</a>. Text in the Roy Gazetteer was queried for English and Scottish Gaelic terms for ‘mill’ and ‘mills’, allowing for several spellings and phonetic variations. This included but was not limited to such terms such as mill, <em>miln</em>, <em>muileann</em>, <em>mhuillin</em>, <em>vulen</em>, <em>vuilin</em>, <em>vulan</em>, <em>voulin,</em> <em>mulen</em>, <em>mulin</em>, and milton. </p>
				
				<p>Text including words with geographic or topographic context were excluded if they i) were a duplicate location, ii) had no association with milling at that location at any point in the interval focused on in our project (c.1729‒1914 CE) , or iii) were found to exist at locations nontypical for mills such as at higher elevation or within peatland/moorland.  Locations associated with, but not limited to, words such as -burn, -town, -ton, -mains, -millgen, -scar, -craig, -crag, -pond and -dam and their plurals were removed from the dataset if no association as indicated above was found.</p>

				<div class="imgcap"><strong>Figure 5</strong>. To identify potential mill sites from the Roy Military Survey Map, we used text search terms like 'mill' and 'mhuillan' to identify mill sites. These terms also show up when referring to streams, such as "Mill Burn", so it was important to remove text referring to geographic features rather than mills. (a) 'mill' (Highland map sheets), (b) <em>allt</em> (Highland map sheets), (c) 'mill' (Lowland map sheets), and (d) 'burn' (Lowland map sheets) from the searchable Roy Gazetteer. <em>Allt</em> is Scottish Gaelic for a burn or stream. Blue boxes indicate locations on the map including those terms. These locations were then further filtered and corrected for distortion. </div>
